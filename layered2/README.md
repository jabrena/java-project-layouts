# Layered architecture

In software engineering, multitier architecture (often referred to as n-tier architecture) 
or multilayer architecture is a clientâ€“server architecture in which 
presentation, application processing and data management functions are physically separated. 
The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the three-tier architecture.
